## [2026-06-10] update | Autoresearch skill + Self-Improving App concept

Stood up the `/autoresearch` skill (`.claude/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md`) — a domain-swap of
Karpathy's `autoresearch` loop (vendored at `/autoresearch`): research a knowledge gap → adversarially
verify → keep only if it passes an acceptance gate → ingest into the wiki → log → repeat. The wiki is
the artifact that improves each iteration (his loop lowers `val_bpb`; ours grows verified knowledge).
Orchestrates the existing [[wiki-ops]] and `deep-research` skills; writes only to `docs/wiki/`.
Slice 1 of an agile rollout — ships on-demand mode; autonomous `loop` and Donny sync are documented,
validated later. Recorded the architecture + 5-phase smart-app roadmap (incl. Donny learning on the
same loop via `donny_knowledge`).
Pages created: [[Self-Improving App]] (concept).
Pages updated: index.md (1 new concept entry).

## [2026-06-10] autoresearch | North Star & KPI scorecard (Slice 1 demo)
Status: kept
Domain: strategy
Sources: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §2/§3/§8 (internal); 2025 SaaS benchmark reports — SaaS Capital,
Optifai, First Page Sage, ScaleXP, HiBob, The SaaS CFO, Vena, Vitally, Lighter Capital (external,
≥2 independent per metric).
Pages created: [[North Star & KPI Scorecard]] (analysis).
Pages updated: index.md (1 new analyses entry).
Note: First on-demand `/autoresearch` run. Validated CAC-payback, LTV:CAC, and NRR targets as
well-calibrated; raised two flags for the user — churn kill-switch has no stated unit (monthly vs
annual), and the rev/employee <$400K gate reads as a Y2–Y3 maturity target, not a Y1 trigger.

## [2026-06-07] ingest | Core Docs Recent Updates Sync

Synced core docs + wiki with codebase work that landed 2026-06-01 → 2026-06-06,
after the 2026-06-02 Plan B ingest. Corrected codebase scale to 60 pages / 183 hooks /
**73 edge functions** (docs said 67/71). Captured six shipped workstreams: DragonShare
notifications pipeline (`dragonshare-notify` fanout + dashboard activity parity), iOS
camera capture (Capacitor Phase 2 begins), legal pages, Outstand account recovery + real
profile photos, CGC submission unblock, and QA staging Plan C (e2e smoke gate).
Pages created: [[Core Docs Recent Updates Sync Session]] (source); [[Outstand]] (entity — first dedicated page).
Pages updated: [[DragonShare]] (notifications & activity section), [[Capacitor Native Shell]]
(Phase 2 camera + legal pages), [[Donny AI]] (73 functions), [[Supabase]] (73 functions),
[[DragonCandy Platform]] (scale 60/183/73 + Outstand link), [[QA CI/CD Gate]] (Plan C shipped);
index.md (2 new entries). Also synced `CLAUDE.md` (67→73) and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
(scale, §5 workstreams, §6 enum triage, §10, live metrics).
Carried forward: `campaign_status` enum still missing `in_progress` (see [[Counter-Offer Enum Fix Session]]).

## [2026-06-02] update | QA Staging — frontend env-wiring gap

Post-verification finding folded into the QA staging pages: the app was hardwired to
prod (`client.ts` hardcoded the prod Supabase URL/key, ignoring `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`;
edge callers already used the env var → split-brain). Fixed client.ts + 3 hardcoded
callers to read the env var with prod fallback.
Pages updated: [[QA Staging Supabase (Plan B) Session]] (new "Frontend Env-Wiring Gap"
section), [[Supabase]] (env-wiring caveat).

## [2026-06-02] ingest | QA Staging Supabase (Plan B)

Ingested the Plan B session extract: standing up the isolated staging Supabase project
(`dragoncandy-staging`, ref `mhffqrawgizhprbobcta`) for the CI/CD gate — 213-migration
replay with a 7-class remediation, 71 edge functions deployed, 9 secrets set, Stripe
single-sandbox alignment + webhook endpoint, CSP parity + `cap:sync` verified.
Pages created: [[QA Staging Supabase (Plan B) Session]] (source); [[QA CI/CD Gate]],
[[Migration Replay Drift]] (concepts).
Pages updated: [[Supabase]] (staging env + drift + verify_jwt note), [[Stripe Connect]]
(single-sandbox alignment), index.md (3 new entries).

## [2026-06-01] ingest | Repo-State Sync — DragonShare, Capacitor, Delivery Cluster

Full session-extract ingest closing the gap since the 2026-05-24 backfill. Three new raw
session extracts synthesized from specs/plans/commits (2026-04-27 → 2026-06-01), then ingested.
Pages created: [[DragonShare]], [[Capacitor Native Shell]] (entities);
[[Trust-Then-Flag Model]], [[Two-Path Boost Payment]], [[Payments Split by Surface]] (concepts);
[[DragonShare Amplification Engine Session]], [[Apple App Store Capacitor Phase 1 Session]],
[[Campaign Delivery, Scheduling & Notifications Session]] (sources).
Pages updated: [[DragonDash]], [[Stripe Connect]], [[Supabase]], [[Donny AI]],
[[DragonCandy Platform]] (entities); [[Data Flywheel]] (concept); index.md (8 new entries).
Contradiction flagged: the DragonShare admin-queue/Donny-scoring model from the original
2026-04-27 spec was superseded by the trust-then-flag model — recorded in [[Trust-Then-Flag Model]].
Also synced core docs: PROJECT_CONTEXT scale (60/184/71) + DragonShare/Capacitor status,
DATABASE_SCHEMA (`user_roles`, `donny_scheduled_posts`), prd/product-vision native-app note.

## [2026-05-24] ingest | Session Handoff Backfill — 6 Source Pages
