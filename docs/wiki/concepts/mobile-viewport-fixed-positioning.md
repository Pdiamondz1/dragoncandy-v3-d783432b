# Mobile Viewport & Fixed Positioning

Rules for keeping bottom-anchored mobile UI (bottom nav, Donny's mobile sheet, sheet
footers, sticky CTAs) actually on-screen. Two independent failure classes hit DragonCandy;
both are now guarded by contract.

## 1. The containing-block trap (the PR #224 / PR #230 class)

A `position:fixed` element anchors to the viewport **only if no ancestor has a transform,
`will-change: transform`, `filter`, or similar** — any of those makes that ancestor the
containing block, and "fixed" silently becomes "pinned to that ancestor".

`PageTransition` wraps **every route**, so when its `motion.div` carried `y: 6 → 0`, every
fixed element inside the app was at risk. Worse, framer-motion (LazyMotion, async
`domAnimation` features) **stalls at `initial` on first page load**, leaving
`transform: translateY(6px)` + `opacity: 0` inline forever (pages render only via the
`ensureVisible` CSS fallback animation). Result: on direct loads/refreshes the mobile
bottom nav anchored to the *bottom of the page content* — reachable only by scrolling to
the absolute end, half-hidden behind Safari's toolbar; after a client-side navigation the
animation sometimes completed and cleared the transform. That inconsistency is why the
founder reported it as "most pages".

**Contract:** `PageTransition` is **opacity-only**. Never add x/y/scale to it (comment in
the file says so). The `ensureVisible` keyframe must not mention `transform` either.

**Defense for overlays:** hand-rolled `fixed inset-0` overlays should still
`createPortal(node, document.body)` (the PR #224 fix for ApplyConfirmation) — body is a
verified-clean containing block; portaling makes an overlay immune to *any* future
transformed ancestor, not just this one.

**Diagnostic (fixed-probe test):** inject
`position:fixed;bottom:0;width:10px;height:10px` into the suspect subtree and compare
`getBoundingClientRect().bottom` to `window.innerHeight` (viewport-anchored) vs the
ancestor's rect bottom (trapped). This settled the root cause in one probe on prod.

## 2. iOS Safari viewport units + toolbar (the invite-sheet class)

The app shell is `div.h-screen` with an inner `overflow-auto` `<main>` — **the document
itself never scrolls**, so iOS Safari's toolbars **never collapse**, and the
toolbar-expanded state is permanent, not transient:

- `vh` is the **large** viewport unit (toolbar collapsed) — a `max-h-[82vh]` bottom sheet
  can exceed the visible height and its footer lands behind the toolbar/home indicator.
  Use **`dvh`** (or `svh`) for anything bottom-anchored on mobile.
- Bottom-fixed footers/nav pad with **`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`**
  (`viewport-fit=cover` is set in index.html, so `env()` is live; it's 0 on desktop).
  Tailwind arbitrary values normalize calc operators — `pb-[calc(1rem+env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]`
  emits valid `calc(1rem + env(...))` (verified in dist CSS).

Applied to the [[Creator Groups (Crews)]] "Invite creators" sheet (`82dvh` + safe-area
footer). `DonnyMobileSheet` already used `dvh`.

## 3. The bottom nav never hides

The nav originally hid on scroll-down (`useScrollDirection`), which stranded users — at
the end of a page the last gesture is always 'down', so the nav (Donny's only mobile
entry point) was gone exactly where users park. PR #231 first added an 80px bottom-reveal
floor; the founder then decided (2026-07-14, same day) the hide behavior itself was the
problem: **the nav is now always visible** and `useScrollDirection` was deleted outright.
If a future feature wants hide-on-scroll chrome, that's a founder-level UX decision —
don't reintroduce it for screen-space reasons alone.

## Key Decisions

- **Delete the trap, don't patch victims:** removing the transform un-traps all ~14
  hand-rolled fixed-position components inside routes at once; portal-to-body remains the
  per-overlay defense-in-depth.
- Reason from the framer **stall state**, not the at-rest ideal: "v12 clears transforms
  when the animation completes" is true and irrelevant when the animation never runs.
