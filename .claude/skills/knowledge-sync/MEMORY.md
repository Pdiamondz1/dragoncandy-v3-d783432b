# knowledge-sync — loop memory

> Read **Lessons** before every run; add a **Run Log** entry at the top after every run.
> Full contract: `docs/wiki/concepts/loop-memory-protocol.md`

## Lessons (read FIRST every run; curated — rewrite/prune as they evolve)

- **[orphans] Run the orphan check every run.** The `wiki-save-answer` flow adds `analyses/`
  pages + syncs RAG but does NOT update `index.md`, so its pages land as catalog orphans
  (caught 2: [[Competitive Advantage]], [[Influencer/Creator Outreach]]). Before finishing,
  list `concepts|entities|analyses/*.md` not referenced in `index.md` and add any missing.
- **[rag-sync] Don't hand-sync after merge.** The committed post-merge git hook auto-runs
  `sync:wiki` + `sync:internal` on a **main** fast-forward that touched `docs/`. Verify via
  `.git/knowledge-sync.log` — `errors=0` is the authority (not counts); confirm retrievability
  with a `content ilike` query on the changed pages.
- **[scope] Branch off `origin/main`, not the just-merged worktree.** A merged feature branch
  is squash-diverged; author knowledge-sync docs on a fresh branch for a clean PR.
- **[runlog-in-pr] Bundle this MEMORY.md Run Log entry INTO the docs PR commit**, not a
  separate follow-up. Forgetting it (as on the #176 run) costs a whole extra PR cycle just to
  persist one bookkeeping line.
- **[rag-verify] `donny_knowledge` has no `source_id` column** — verify retrievability with
  `content ilike '%<distinctive phrase>%'`, not a source/id filter (the query errors otherwise).

## Run log (newest first — add each new entry at the TOP; never edit/delete past entries)

### [2026-06-26] AIOS internal dashboard UI polish (PR #179 → docs PR pending)
- Output: this docs PR — `raw/sessions/2026-06-26-aios-ui-polish.md`, new
  `concepts/aios-internal-shell.md`, `index.md` (Concepts + Sources), `log.md` ingest entry,
  PROJECT_CONTEXT active-workstream bullet, and THIS run-log entry (bundled per [runlog-in-pr]).
- Happened: authored on a fresh branch off origin/main (per [scope]); orphan check clean
  (the for-loop over concepts|entities|analyses found 0); dropped a dangling
  `[[AIOS Stakeholder Invite]]` wikilink (PR #178 was shipped but never wiki-ingested — a
  pre-existing gap, left out of scope). Code PR #179 already merged; this is the paired docs PR.
- Worked: [scope] + [orphans] + [runlog-in-pr] Lessons all applied. New concept compounds on
  [[Donny Chat UX]] (the light-vs-dark sibling) instead of a thin duplicate.
- Failed: none yet (RAG sync + verify-knowledge happen after this PR merges + main ff).
- Remember: **gap noticed** — PR #178 (AIOS Stakeholder Invite) shipped without a wiki page;
  worth a backfill ingest in a future knowledge-sync (don't let merged AIOS features skip the wiki).

### [2026-06-24] Stripe webhook revival + dual-secret (PRs #173/#174 → docs PR #176)
- Output: PR #176 — `raw/sessions/2026-06-24-stripe-webhook-revival-dual-secret.md`, new
  `concepts/stripe-webhook-delivery.md`, `entities/stripe-connect.md` (Webhook Delivery
  section), `index.md` + `log.md` entries, PROJECT_CONTEXT active-workstream bullet.
- Happened: authored on a fresh branch off origin/main (per [scope]); orphan check clean;
  Codex-clean (docs-only); merged #176; ff'd main → post-merge hook synced RAG (wiki: +1
  inserted/49 updated/errors=0; internal: +1/69 updated/errors=0). Confirmed retrievability via
  `content ilike` — "Stripe Webhook Delivery" present (updated 03:27Z).
- Worked: [scope] + [orphans] + [rag-sync] Lessons all held — no hand-sync, no orphans, clean PR.
- Failed: forgot to bundle THIS run-log entry into #176 (this is a follow-up PR); first verify
  query used a non-existent `source_id` column on `donny_knowledge`.
- Remember: both failures → **promoted to Lessons** ([runlog-in-pr], [rag-verify]).

### [2026-06-24] Test-Mode Stripe UX session (PR #168 → docs PR #169)
- Output: PR #169 — `raw/sessions/2026-06-24-test-mode-stripe-ux.md`, new `concepts/test-mode-stripe-ux.md`, `entities/stripe-connect.md` cross-link, `index.md` + `log.md` entries, PROJECT_CONTEXT active-workstream. [[verify-knowledge]] verdict: `done:true` (all 3 met, first pass).
- Happened: authored docs on a fresh branch off origin/main (per [scope] Lesson), ingested, ran orphan check (clean), opened+merged #169, ff'd main → post-merge hook synced RAG (wiki: +1 inserted/48 updated/errors=0). Confirmed retrievability via `content ilike` (page present, updated 19:15Z).
- Worked: [scope] + [orphans] + [rag-sync] Lessons all applied cleanly — no hand-sync, no orphans, clean PR. Removed one dangling `[[Lovable Edge Function Deploy Gap]]` wikilink (no such page) to keep lint green.
- Failed: none. (Auto-merge is disabled on the repo → had to poll CI then merge #169 manually; not a knowledge issue.)
- Remember: repo has no auto-merge — a docs PR needs a CI poll-then-merge, not `gh pr merge --auto`. (advisory)

### [2026-06-24] Loop memory shipped + security triage capture + orphan fix
- Output: PR #166 (`raw/sessions/2026-06-24-…`, `concepts/security-definer-advisor-triage.md`,
  `loop-memory-protocol.md` status, index.md+log.md, PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) + this orphan-fix PR
  (index.md entries for the 2 orphans).
- Happened: captured the session, merged #166, RAG auto-synced (errors=0, confirmed by content
  query). Close-the-loop lint caught 2 pre-existing orphans → fixed in this follow-up.
- Worked: post-merge hook auto-synced both RAG stores; `content ilike` verified retrievability.
- Failed: missed appending this Run Log entry to #166 itself (the loop-memory dogfood) → done
  here; the 2 orphans were pre-existing from `wiki-save-answer`.
- Remember: orphan-check + the wiki-save-answer gap → **promoted to Lessons**.

<!-- Template for each run (newest on top):
### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <session/topic>
- Output: <wiki session source + pages + core-doc edits; never a duplicate of the output>
- Happened: <what was captured, which core docs refreshed, RAG synced?>
- Worked: <what went well>
- Failed: <what the verify-knowledge verdict's missing[] flagged / what went wrong>
- Remember: <takeaway; note "→ promoted to Lessons" when durable>
